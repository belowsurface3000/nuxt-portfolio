# Nuxt first try | Portfolio page

## Info
After one year of React development this project was my first try with Vue.js and then Nuxt for SSR. The goal was convert my portfolio page from React to Vue/Nuxt and implementing functionalities like global state management, email sending and smooth scrolling to anchors within the main page.
To get the contact form working, emailjs credentials are needed in an .env file under this variable names:

VUE_APP_EMAIL_SERVICE=
VUE_APP_EMAIL_TEMPLATE=
VUE_APP_EMAIL_USER=

Two pages are missing in the public repo /src/views/ for privacy reasons:
- datenschutz.vue
- impressum.vue

## How to develop
- clone the repo
- $ npm i
- $ npm run dev
